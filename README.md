# Responsive Weather App UI

`[HTML5]` `[CSS3]` `[Flexbox]` `[Responsive Design]` `[SVG]`

This project is a high-fidelity, visually appealing **UI-only** prototype for a weather application. It was built from scratch using only HTML and CSS, focusing on modern styling techniques, responsive layout, and a clean user experience.

This is a strong portfolio piece for demonstrating front-end styling and layout skills, as it shows an understanding of color, spacing, typography, and responsive design.

## ✨ Features

* **Modern Gradient UI:** Uses a `linear-gradient` background to create a visually engaging card.
* **Flexbox Layout:** The search bar and weather details sections are built with **CSS Flexbox** for perfect alignment and flexible spacing.
* **Inline SVG Icons:** Uses embedded SVGs for all icons (search, weather, details). This is a modern, high-performance alternative to icon fonts, as it requires no external libraries and the icons are infinitely scalable and stylable with CSS.
* **Fully Responsive:** The layout fluidly adapts to all screen sizes. On narrow screens, the "Weather Details" section neatly stacks vertically.
* **Glass-like Details:** The details section uses an `rgba` background to create a semi-transparent "frosted glass" effect.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts & Skills Demonstrated

* **Advanced CSS Styling:** `linear-gradient`, `box-shadow`, `border-radius`, and `rgba` transparency to build a modern, non-standard UI.
* **CSS Flexbox:** Used multiple times to create robust, aligned, and flexible layouts for the search bar and the details section.
* **Responsive Design:** Using a `max-width` and `width: 100%` approach, combined with a simple `@media` query, to ensure the UI is flawless on mobile.
* **HTML Structure:** Clean, semantic HTML that is easy to read and maintain.
* **UI/UX Focus:** A clear visual hierarchy (main temp is largest, details are smaller) and ample white space for a clean, readable interface.

## ⭐️ Future Enhancements

This project is the *front-end UI* for a full application. The clear next steps would be:

1.  **Add JavaScript:** Add event listeners to the search bar.
2.  **API Integration:** Connect the app to a real-time weather API (like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI).
3.  **Dynamic Content:** Use JavaScript to take the API data and dynamically update the placeholder text and icons.
